This project implements a deep learning model to classify iris flower species using the popular Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes data cleaning, encoding categorical labels, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Neural Network Model: A feedforward neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras is used for classification. The model includes hidden layers with ReLU activation and an output layer with softmax activation.
Model Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using training and validation accuracy and loss metrics. Visualizations of training progress are provided.
Model Saving and Loading: The trained model is saved for future use, allowing easy loading and prediction without retraining.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

Future Improvements
Experiment with different neural network architectures.
Implement hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Use cross-validation for a more robust evaluation.
